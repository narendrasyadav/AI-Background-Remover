AI Background Remover Web App



A simple yet powerful web application built with Python and Gradio to automatically remove backgrounds from images. This tool leverages the rembg library to provide high-quality, AI-powered background segmentation. It features a clean user interface where you can upload an image, select a processing model, optionally sharpen the result, and download the final image with a transparent background.

&nbsp; Features



&nbsp;   Easy Image Upload: Simple drag-and-drop or file selection interface.



&nbsp;   Multiple AI Models: Choose from several rembg models (e.g., u2net, isnet-general-use) to balance speed and accuracy.



&nbsp;   Advanced Alpha Matting: Utilizes sophisticated alpha matting for cleaner edges on complex objects like hair and fur.



&nbsp;   Optional Sharpening: Apply a sharpening filter to enhance the details of the foreground object after background removal.



&nbsp;   One-Click Download: Instantly download the processed image with a transparent background as a PNG file.



&nbsp;   Fully Web-Based: No complex installation needed for the end-user; just run the script and open the provided link in your browser.



&nbsp; Getting Started



Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites



&nbsp;   Python 3.8 or newer



&nbsp;   pip (Python package installer)



Installation \& Setup



&nbsp;   Clone the repository:



&nbsp;   git clone \[https://github.com/YOUR\_USERNAME/YOUR\_REPOSITORY.git](https://github.com/YOUR\_USERNAME/YOUR\_REPOSITORY.git)

&nbsp;   cd YOUR\_REPOSITORY



&nbsp;   Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):



&nbsp;   # For macOS/Linux

&nbsp;   python3 -m venv venv

&nbsp;   source venv/bin/activate



&nbsp;   # For Windows

&nbsp;   python -m venv venv

&nbsp;   .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate



&nbsp;   Install the required dependencies:

&nbsp;   Create a file named requirements.txt and add the following lines to it:



&nbsp;   gradio

&nbsp;   rembg

&nbsp;   Pillow

&nbsp;   numpy



&nbsp;   Then, run the following command in your terminal:



&nbsp;   pip install -r requirements.txt



&nbsp;   Note: The first time you run the app, rembg will download the selected AI model, which may take a few moments.



Running the Application



&nbsp;   Save your Python code as app.py.



&nbsp;   Run the following command in your terminal from the project directory:



&nbsp;   python app.py



&nbsp;   Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided in the terminal (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:7860).



üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used



&nbsp;   Gradio: For creating the fast and interactive web UI for the model.



&nbsp;   rembg: For the core AI-powered background removal functionality.



&nbsp;   Pillow (PIL): For image processing tasks like sharpening, format conversion, and handling image data.



&nbsp;   Python: The core programming language.
